While we run tests covering most conceivable situations before release, bugs still happen.
Send us a file of Debug Dump Binaries (DDBs) so that we can provide technical support. The DDB file is safely encrypted and includes all the compilation steps and error logs. </br></br>

Please refer to Trouble and contact our Technical Support Team or email us.
